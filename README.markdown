# cffi-clutter

This are a start of Common Lisp bindings for [Clutter](http://clutter-project.org/) toolkit. Currently it contains only semi-automatically generated bindings to most raw functions for version 0.9.6. I rather doubt I will get anywhere in any reasonable time, but hopefully this might become an useful basis for someone else.
